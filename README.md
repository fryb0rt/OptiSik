# OptiSik
Simple library for optimization
Contents:

1) Solver for linear programming problems (optimizers/simplexSolver.h)
Solver accepts all types of constraints ( <= , ==, >= ) and floating-point or integer variables that can
be bounded or unbounded.

2) Implementation of LU materix decomposition (data/lumatrix.h)
Decomposition of matrix in lower and upper triangle. 
Allows solving of linear equations, matrix inversion and determinant computation.

The plan is to add more features.
